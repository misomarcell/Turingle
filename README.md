# Turingle
Turingle is a tool witch connects random chat sites with the [cleverbot](http://www.cleverbot.com/) so people bacame the subject of a [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) while they know nothing about who they talking with. It sometimes funny and sometimes interesting how well the AI can answer questions and keep up the conversation with the strangers. The application currently supports 7strangers(dot)com and shamchat(dot)com, but you can add others easily. Feedback and ideas are welcome!

2. Enter it to the program
3. Press the *Create* button
4. Enter the site and let it talk
