# Turingle
Turingle is a hobbi project of mine. The plan is to connect some random chat sites with cleverbot and watch people become the subject of a [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test). The application currently only works with 7strangers(dot)com, but I'll add support to others soon. Feedback and ideas are welcome!

## How to use?
1. Get a [Cleverbot API Key](https://www.cleverbot.com/api/)
2. Enter it to the program
3. Press the *Create* button
4. Enter the site and let it talk
